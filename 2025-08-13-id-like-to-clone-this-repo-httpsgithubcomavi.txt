 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

> i'd like to clone this repo https://github.com/Avinava/simple-vite-react-express

⏺ I'll clone the repository for you.

⏺ Bash(git clone https://github.com/Avinava/simple-vite-react-express.git)
  ⎿  Cloning into 'simple-vite-react-express'...

⏺ The repository has been successfully cloned into the simple-vite-react-express directory.

> why don't i see that repo in my github repositories directory?

⏺ The repository was cloned to your current working directory (/Users/milohayden/Documents/GitHub),
  not to /Users/milohayden/Documents/github (note the lowercase 'g').

  Let me show you where it was created:

⏺ List(..)
  ⎿  Listed 533 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ You can see the simple-vite-react-express/ directory is in /Users/milohayden/Documents/GitHub (with
   capital 'G'). If you want it in your other directory with lowercase 'g', I can move it there for
  you.

> i mean when i go to my github web directory

⏺ The repository you cloned is not your own repository - it's a clone of someone else's repository
  (Avinava's). When you clone a repository, it doesn't appear in your GitHub account's repositories.

  If you want this to appear in your GitHub repositories, you would need to:

  1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account
  2. Push the cloned code to your new repository

  Would you like me to help you create a new repository in your GitHub account and push this code
  there?

> yes please

⏺ I'll help you create a new repository in your GitHub account and push the code there. Let me create
   a todo list to track this process.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Navigate to the cloned repository directory             
     ☐ Create a new repository on GitHub using gh CLI
     ☐ Update the remote origin to point to your new repository
     ☐ Push the code to your new repository

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Navigate to the cloned repository directory             
     ☐ Create a new repository on GitHub using gh CLI
     ☐ Update the remote origin to point to your new repository
     ☐ Push the code to your new repository

⏺ Bash(cd simple-vite-react-express && pwd)
  ⎿  /Users/milohayden/Documents/github/simple-vite-react-express

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Navigate to the cloned repository directory             
     ☐ Create a new repository on GitHub using gh CLI
     ☐ Update the remote origin to point to your new repository
     ☐ Push the code to your new repository

⏺ Bash(cd simple-vite-react-express && gh repo create simple-vite-react-express --public --source=.
      --remote=origin --push)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):cd:1: no such file or directory: simple-vite-react-express

⏺ Let me navigate to the correct directory first:

⏺ Bash(gh repo create simple-vite-react-express --public --source=. --remote=origin --push)
  ⎿  Error: X Unable to add remote "origin"

     https://github.com/Glurby/simple-vite-react-express

⏺ The remote "origin" already exists and points to the original repository. Let me update the remote
  and then push:

⏺ Bash(git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Glurby/simple-vite-react-express.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Navigate to the cloned repository directory             
     ☒ Create a new repository on GitHub using gh CLI
     ☒ Update the remote origin to point to your new repository
     ☐ Push the code to your new repository

⏺ Bash(git push -u origin main)
  ⎿  Error: error: src refspec main does not match any
     error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Glurby/simple-vite-react-express.git'

⏺ Let me check the current branch name:

⏺ Bash(git branch)
  ⎿  * master

⏺ Bash(git push -u origin master)
  ⎿  branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.          
     To https://github.com/Glurby/simple-vite-react-express.git
      * [new branch]      master -> master

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Navigate to the cloned repository directory             
     ☒ Create a new repository on GitHub using gh CLI
     ☒ Update the remote origin to point to your new repository
     ☒ Push the code to your new repository

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully created a new repository in your GitHub account and pushed the code.

  The repository is now available at: https://github.com/Glurby/simple-vite-react-express

  You should now see it in your GitHub repositories list on the web.
